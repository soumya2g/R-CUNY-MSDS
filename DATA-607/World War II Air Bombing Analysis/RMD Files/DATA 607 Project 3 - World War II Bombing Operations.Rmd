### Assignment Summary:

Below is the summary of the assignment - 

![](./Problem Statement.png)

### R Libraries:

Load necessary libraries -

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)

```

### Data Processing Steps :

Below are the steps to be followed to generate the final output -

1.  Create a CSV file in a "Wide" format which has the same information as the table shown above in the problem statement:

![](./airline_data.png)

2.  Import data into R:

```{r}
airlineDF <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soumya2g/R-CUNY-MSDS/master/DATA-607/Airline%20Delays/airlines.csv",header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(airlineDF) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>% scroll_box(width="100%",height="300px")
```

3.  Use tidyr function gather() to unpivot destination columns into a variable and replace '.' character in Destination variable with a space character:

```{r}
airlineTidyDF <- airlineDF %>% gather(key = destination, value = "No. of Flights", -airline, -status) 
airlineTidyDF$destination <- str_replace_all(airlineTidyDF$destination, "\\."," ")
airlineTidyDF  %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>% scroll_box(width="100%",height="300px")
```

4.  Use tidyr spread() function on 'status' column to to have two separate columns of 'on time' and 'delayed' flights:

After spreading the data on 'status', using dplyr mutate() function, I have calculated 'total_flights' and 'deayed_percentage' for each airline and destination combination.

```{r}
airlineDF1 <- airlineTidyDF %>% spread(status,"No. of Flights") %>% mutate(total_flights = (delayed + `on time`)) %>%  mutate(delayed_percent = (delayed/total_flights)) 

airlineDF1 %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>% scroll_box(width="100%",height="300px")

```

5.  Summerize the data set by airline:

Based on the summerized data by airline across all destinations and the Bar plot below ALASKA arline shows a higher percentage of flight delays compared to AM WEST airline.

```{r}
airlineSummaryDF <- airlineDF1 %>% group_by(airline) %>% summarise(total_delayed = sum(delayed), total_on_time = sum(`on time`), total_fights = sum(total_flights)) %>% mutate(delayed_percent = total_delayed/total_fights)

airlineSummaryDF  %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>% scroll_box(width="100%",height="200px")

## Bar plot with overall Delayed% by airline

ggplot(airlineSummaryDF, aes(y=delayed_percent, x=airline, color=airline, fill=airline)) + 
    geom_bar( stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label = percent(delayed_percent)), vjust = -.5) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

```

6.  Plot  Delayed% by Airline for each Destination:

Based on the below Grouped Bar plot, in all of the destinations AM WEST has higher percentage of delayed flights compared to ALASKA.

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
ggplot(airlineDF1, aes(y=delayed_percent, x=airline, color=airline, fill=airline)) + 
    geom_bar( stat="identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label = percent(delayed_percent)), vjust = -.5) +
    facet_wrap(~destination) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

7.  Comparing the 'on time' and delayed 'delayed' flight count comarison:

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
ggplot(airlineTidyDF, aes(x = airline, y = `No. of Flights`, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = "stack") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = `No. of Flights`), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  facet_grid(~ destination)
```



## Conclusion:

Comparing above 3 Bar Plots, few interesting facts can be highlighted -

  - Even though, ALASKA airline shows a better track record in terms of having lesser percentage of flight delays when analyzed by individual destinations but overall ALASKA arline has a higher percentage of delayed flights compared to AM WEST.
  
  -  In Phoenix, AM WEST airline operates many more flights (5,000+) compared to ALASKA (200+). But the percentages of delays for AM WEST airline is only 2.7% higher compared to ALASKA airline.
  
  -  In Seattle, ALASKA operates more flights (2146 vs. 262) compared to AM WEST, but has a much lower (9.1% lower) flight delay percentage compared to AM WEST.
